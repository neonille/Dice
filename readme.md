## How to Play

1. Power up your Atari 2600 (or emulator, we won't judge).
2. Load this ROM.
3. Stare in awe at the digital dice.
4. Press the fire button to roll. (No actual fire required.)
5. Marvel at your new number. Repeat as needed for all your board game needs.

## Features
- True random(ish) dice rolls
- Authentic 2600 graphics (blocky and beautiful)
- Sound effects that will echo through the ages
- No batteries required (unless your console needs them)

## Why?
Because sometimes you just want to roll dice with 128 bytes of RAM and a dream.

## Troubleshooting
- If you roll a 7, please contact your local exorcist.
- If nothing happens, try plugging in the joystick. Or your TV. Or both.

## Credits
- Code: You (or someone equally awesome)
